This project applies to the healthcare industry. On a top level, the project aims to predict length of stay of patients (LOS)  at hospitals. 
Hospitals often find it difficult to know when beds will be available for new patients because they are not sure what the LOS of admitted patients would be.  This became quite an issue during the Covid-19 pandemic. This project will  take a deep dive into this problem and try to look for solutions using machine learning.
A dataset that has patient hospitalization information is being used for this project.   It aims to predict the length of stay of a patient.
